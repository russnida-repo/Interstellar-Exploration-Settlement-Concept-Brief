This repository contains the **Interstellar Exploration & Settlement Concept Brief**, a strategic feasibility framework that emphasizes **evidence-based decision gates**, **survivability**, and **engineering realism** over optimistic assumptions. It is **not** an engineering design or near-term mission proposal; it outlines the constraints, decision logic, and phased architecture that would govern any future interstellar effort under known physics.

## What this is

- A **decision framework** for interstellar exploration and (conditional) settlement  
- A **phased architecture**: reconnaissance → decision & development → cryogenic transit → arrival & survival  
- A **survivability-first** approach: arrival viability matters more than onboard comfort  

## What this is not

- Not a funded program plan or schedule  
- Not an engineering design package  
- Not a claim that interstellar settlement is near-term  

---

## Core premise

A human interstellar mission is **irreversible** once launched:

- **No rescue**  
- **No resupply**  
- **No recall**  

So the program is structured around **elimination-based decision gates** and conservative assumptions.

## Candidate targets (current focus)

The brief prioritizes the four closest known exoplanets with plausible habitability potential and ranks them primarily by **stellar radiation stability**, **atmospheric survivability**, and **long-term climate potential** (not proximity alone):

| Planet | Distance (ly) | Notes (high-level) |
|---|---:|---|
| **Proxima Centauri b** | 4.24 | Closest, but harsh stellar environment |
| **Teegarden’s Star b** | 12.6 | Promising but uncertain |
| **GJ 1002 b** | 15.8 | Ranked most likely habitable |
| **TRAPPIST-1e** | 40.7 | Well-studied; habitability uncertain |

**Habitability ranking (most → least likely):**  
**GJ 1002 b → Teegarden’s Star b → TRAPPIST-1e → Proxima Centauri b**
